        There are two allowable scenarios. In the first scenario a phase may be
        instantiated without being associated with an optimal control problem.
        If this is the case then the default values of `None` for the phase
        number and 'X' for the phase suffix remain.

        In the second scenario a phase is instantiated with an associated
        optimal control problem or is associated with an optimal control
        problem after the first type of instantiation. In this case the phase
        is appended to the protected `_phases` attribute of the
        :obj:`OptimalControlProblem`, the phase number is set according to its
        position in the order of addition to the optimal controls problem's
        phases, and its phase suffix is set as a string version of the phase
        number. Finally a replacement of any symbols that may have been used in
        supplementary information about the phase that contained the placeholder
        'X' phase suffix are renamed and substituted.

        No checking is done to see whether the phase is already associated with
        the optimal control problem in question or any other optimal control
        problem. The reason being that if the setter method for this property is
        accessed after having already been set then an `AttributeError` is
        raised (see below). The reason this class works like that is to avoid
        having to allow phases to be disassociated from an
        :obj:`OptimalControlProblem` and thus having to handled the complexities
        that would come with the phase renumbering and substitution of any
