"""Integration tests module for multiphase problems.

This module includes a trivial test problem in which a unit mass is slid from
position x = 0 to x = 1 as fast as possible, with the additional constraints
that velocity v = 0 at t0 and tF.

The problem is split into multiple phases of equal length (distance) by adding
phase endpoint constraints on the position variables. Continuity is imposed by
adding problem endpoint constraints between time and velocity of the unit mass
between adjacent phases.
